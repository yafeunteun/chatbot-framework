* Messenger Echo Bot

** How to deploy 

*** Using zappa

In this directory, create a =zappa_settings.json= file (see example below) 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
{
    "dev": {
        "app_function": "main.app",
        "aws_region": "eu-west-1",
        "profile_name": "default",
        "project_name": "messenger_echobot",
        "runtime": "python3.6",
        "environment_variables": {
            "FB_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<TO_COMPLETE>",
            "FB_VERIFY_TOKEN": "<TO_COMPLETE>",
        }
    }
}
#+END_SRC

This will allow you to deploy the bot on Amazon AWS lambda taking care of settings up 
API Gateway. Don't forget to replace the items in the =json= file 
with your own values. Notice though that =app_function= and =runtime=
should remain the same.

When it's done you can deploy the bot using 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
zappa deploy
#+END_SRC

and update the function using (if you already have deployed 
the bot but want to update it)
#+BEGIN_SRC 
zappa update
#+END_SRC
